If you want to do anything in the direction of starting an online
business, I would recommend this book. Together with [[/books/2018/06/02/the-personal-mba/][Personal MBA]] it
forms the best introduction I can think of right now.

It is a short step-by-step description of finding, validating &
launching digital products and an introduction on how to setup
processes and automations so that you make yourself dispensible for
a smooth business.

The focus lies on small businesses, called micropreneurship or
bootstrapping, which can be done by one person or a small team.

This will mean you will target markets that are small enough so that
you can target them with a small budget.

Definitly worth the read. I loved the no-bullshit approach.
