This book was interesting. I like Sam Harris' Podcast because he talks
with intellectuals of different kinds about the uncontrollable nature
of our thinking, our place in the community and how science could help
along the way.

The most interesting fact for me was `callosotomy`. Doctors did
split the hemispheres in the brain in an attempt to heal or lessen the
effect of spasms or seizures. Doing that they soon realized that the
two hemispheres began to form separate identities.

This fact was mind-blowing. Since each of the two hemispheres
cross-control one side of the body and register one side of the bodies
perceptive inputs like the eyes (think of [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes#/media/File:Descartes_diagram.png][Descartes]]), the scientist
could show different things to either side of the brain and the other
side would not have noticed it.

This suggests that we may inhabit multiple `selves` which are
forming the resulting selve to alternating degrees.

Sam Harris suggests that we have less control over our thought than
most of us want to admit. But by being mindful of this very fact we
may be able to regain some of that control back.

Being mindful is not a matter of thinking more clearly about
experience, it is the act of experiencing more clearly.

Studies have shown that 50 percent of our waking life our mind is
wandering. In that time the `default-mode network` (a specific region
of our brain) is more active. This region seems to be responsible for
our tendency to think about andjudge ourselves, which leads to the
perception of "I", the single, thinking entity.

Meditation, can lessen the activity in the DMN up to the point that
experienced meditators can weaken the activity even when they are not
meditating.

How to approach meditation from different Buddhist schools:

- gradual approach :: focus on "my" breathing until the "I" dissolves
     and you realize there is no self
- sudden realization :: begin already assuming the self is an
     illusion and the self does not exist

Sam Harris seems to favor the latter.

The second half of the book talks about "spirituality". It explains
that a multitude of spiritual experiences are common to all types of
believers, as well as non-believers. Thus it must be a concept
non-specific to religion.

Furthermore Harris describes Eastern Religions as empirical at their
core as they are constantly concerned with experience and observation.
As an atheist, I like this way of thinking.

As manuals for contemplative understanding, the Bible and the Koran
are worse than useless.

The rest of the book talks about how to avoid bad gurus and how drugs
can be part of your spiritual journey. Especially the part about bad
gurus, though entertaining, feels more like a rant than some practical
contemplation. 

All in all, I liked the book. 

Since I believe that we are the inevitable product of all the input we
get from our surroundings, we have to control the receptivity for
trash information, habitual thinking and automatism in our life to
find spirituality in our life. Meditation can help taming a wandering
mind that all too happily rides the wave of the default-mode network!
