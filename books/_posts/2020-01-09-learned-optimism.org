An interesting read. The first 11 chapters discuss the need for
optimism. It explains depression as a symptom of our increasingly
individualistic self and provides some questionnaires to evaluate ones
disposition to pessimistic or negative thoughts along a variety of
examples from other people. I skimmed or skipped much of it, because I
already know a lot about automatic negative thoughts and my own hang
to distortion of reality by somewhat negative beliefs.

Luckily the last 4 chapters are a quick summary of the methods and
techniques for which I started this book.

The core principle follows the ABCDE method developed by Albert Ellis
for the Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT). The method handles
all situations in the same way:

- A (Adversity) :: Identify the adversity that lead to pessimistic thinking
- B (Belief) :: Identify your belief
- C (Consequences) :: Notice the negative automatic thinking and the resulting consequences
- D (Disputation) :: Ask for evidence? alternatives? implications? usefulness?
- E (Energization) :: Be attentive to the change of emotion and energy, when rectifying your beliefs and earlier proposed consequences
