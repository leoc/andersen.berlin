Perhaps the best book I read in 2019. A book that invites one to dream
of a better world. Discussing universal basic income and many other
things as the solution to todays problems of increasing automation,
unemployment & poverty from a rather pragmatic point of view.

I also recommend most interviews of the author on youtube. A
light and refreshing turn on todays social problems.
