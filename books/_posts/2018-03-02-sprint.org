I love this book. It introduces the reader to a process that can help
you to evaluate a specific solution to a problem within one week.

It discusses: 

- Finding Consensus in a Team
- How to find a problem
- Create a specific solution
- Building a prototype
- Finding test candidates
- Evaluating the product with these test candidates

I love the decision to avoid code. You can evaluate solutions just with a
powerpoint application. Where you can click an object on the slide and
jump to another view of your virtual prototype.

This idea should be in anyones head who thinks about creating a
software product! 

1) Think about your solution and the viability first.
2) Then validate the solution with WYSIWYG tools. Repeat if necessary
   to refine your vision of the product.
3) Then eventually begin the implementation.

Overall a book I would recommend. 

Agile software devlopment methodologies also make use the notion of
SPRINTs as they refine the product in an assimilably recurring
process.
