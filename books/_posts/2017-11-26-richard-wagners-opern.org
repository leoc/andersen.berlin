This one was an interesting read for me. In 2017 I began looking into
Wagners opera as a singer. I like the intensity and agitating
experience of singing parts for `Siegfried`, `Lohengrin` or
`Siegmund`.

This book includes short summaries of Wagners life. When and how he
wrote his opera. What they meant and how they differ from the epics
that were know to that time (for instance moving the Flying Dutchman's
setting from Scotland to Norway).

Furthermore the book introduces the reader to the plots of most of
Wagners opera in a entertaining way.

Overall I enjoyed reading this book for a quick introduction!
