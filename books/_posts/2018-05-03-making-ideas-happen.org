I liked the book. It targets creatives that do not have much structure
in their lifes. As I am already quite knowledgable regarding GTD
methods and alike I did not learn so much about processes.

But, I still learned a bit about the shallow psychological parts of
the book. It discusses the phenomenon of `restistance`. And how we are
looking for novelty when tasks get too dull or repetitive.

Especially the idea of `project plateau`. Every project has plateaus
after the initial excitement wanes. At that point the maker needs to
persist and persevere, but creative types often hop over to other,
more interesting endeavors, which may lead to a backlog of unfinished
projects, frustration and maybe burnout.

- Be attentive to the urge of starting something new and persevere

Also it made clear that the creative need processes and structure
alterating between different roles. You need to be manager and artist
at once. Only in this fashion can we plan, create and bring forth our
projects.
