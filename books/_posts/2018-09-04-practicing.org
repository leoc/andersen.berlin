This book was a beautiful meditation on the life of a musician. It
resonated deeply with me. The fact that you will have to abandon some
dreams to accomplish others is a tragic part of life, which will be
the never receding aftertaste of each and every decision that a human
being makes.

It was beautiful to read the authors retrospective thoughts on his
ambitions, his lost ideals and how he recovered the love of playing
guitar. I felt like living his life. I felt like falling in love with
the guitar. I felt like being this upcoming prodigy. I felt like
losing all hope for all of my ambition. I felt finding this moment of
catharsis.
