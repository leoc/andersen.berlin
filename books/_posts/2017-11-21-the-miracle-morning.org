This one is hard. Not well written. Many repititions. But all in all
with a good message. Conquer your day with morning rituals, getting up
early to have enough time for the important things.

I would not recommend reading it ...

Basically it tells you to find a morning routine that starts at 4:30.

Common sense tells you, that if you get up three hours earlier and you
train to be ready to crush your most important things quickly, instead
of spending 2 hours waking up, you will have three hours more that
day...

Read this blog post instead and take action:

Click-baity title, but better content than in this book.
