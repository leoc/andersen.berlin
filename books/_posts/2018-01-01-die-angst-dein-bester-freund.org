This book was recommended to me by a friend.

I did not like the writing style. It felt like a climber without prior
training in writing, out of a sudden decides to publish a book. Maybe
that's why the author's explanations appear so authentic.

He talks about fear as necessary part of life. As an emotion that
leads to deeper experiences, keeping you in a state of awe in regards
to the accomplishments of others.

When overcome you create a story that contains ups and downs, which
essentially makes it worth telling.
