This one was a very interesting read.  Beginning my holidays I
decided to let a book of fiction slip into my stash of books and I do
not regret it at all.

Set in pre-colonial Ghana *The Hundred Wells of Salaga* by *Ayesha
Harruna Attah* tells the story of two women: Amina and Wurche. Caused
by the intervening colonial powers and the intensified slave trade
their lifes are about to change immensely. While Wurches family
profits from the slave trade Amina falls victim to it until both paths
cross.

I learned a lot about oppression of the female gender, religious
conversion, slave trade and the incredible suffering as a slave in
pre-colonial Ghana.

I love stories with well-written female characters by female authors,
that allow me to live and see through their eyes, giving me a shred of
understanding of what women have to live through and how they feel in
a patriachaic societies every day.

If you have something similar you can recommend to me, please do not
hesitate to send me a mail! <3
