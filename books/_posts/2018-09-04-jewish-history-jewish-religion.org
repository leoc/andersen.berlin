I had a discussion with a friend about the state of Isreal and I
realized that I know nothing about the Isreal-Palestine-conflict.

Although I know a bit about the old testament and about the cruelties
of nazi germany, I lack a lot of understanding about the centuries
before that. So I will have a lot of reading to do to catch up with
that topic.

Israel Shahak survived the Holocaust, was a liberal intellectual and a
former chairman of the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights.
He explains the anti-gentile stance in orthodox judaism which many
people see as the foundation of zionism.

In the book he takes a stance against the apologetic arguments of
proponents of the judaic state by explaining the history of judaism. I
learned a lot about the Talmud as authoritive text in orthodox judaism,
and how it preached anti-gentile sentiments and how judaism was just
as bloodthirsty as any other religion.

I still have a lot of reading to do to form an actual opinion, as this
might be just one perspective. Still I recommend it a lot to everyone
intestested in this topic.
