I had a discussion with a friend about the Isreal-Palestine-conflict
and the position of Isreal. It became a heated discussion. My naive
standpoint is, that every person needs a place to live, to call their
home, and idiology should not be able to claim possession over a land
casting people out that have another opinion.

Still I realized that I know next to nothing about jewish history or
the history of Israel (exept for the cruelties by the Nazis). So I
think I will have to do a lot to catch up on that topic.

The author, Israel Shahak, was an Israeli professor of organic
chemistry, at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, a Holocaust survivor and
a former chairman of the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights. In
his book he explains the anti-gentile stance in historic orthodox
judaism which seems to be the foundation of zionism.

He takes a stance against the apologetic arguments of proponents of
a jewish state by explaining the history of judaism. I learned a lot
about the Talmud as authoritive text in orthodox judaism, and how it
preaches anti-gentile sentiments and how judaism was just as
bloodthirsty as any other religion.

I still have a lot of reading to do to form an actual opinion, as this
might be just one perspective. Still I recommend it a lot to everyone
intestested in this topic.

If there is a book you think I should read, I would be delighted if
you could share it with me. I love to get to know more diverse
opinions.
