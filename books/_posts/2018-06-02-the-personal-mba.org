I don't know how I came to reading this book. If I remember correctly
I found the link to its Amazon page via a blog article that
recommended it due to its form. It reads a lot like a glossary,
introducing all the keywords necessary for starting and running a
business and pointing into the direction of further reading material.

I enjoyed it a lot. Most of the stuff wasn't new to me, but some were
formulated differently changing the perspective a bit.

It felt a lot like a reference book. You can directly jump to the
topics of your interests. If a keyword is occurring again throughout
the book, it is printed in bold so you know there is a mini chapter
for an explanation.

I don't know whether this book replaces an actual MBA degree but I
think it is a wonderful introduction for people who started a business
with a different skill set (like engineering) and want to learn more
about the basics of management.

I liked the concept of /Akrasia/, which describes the experience of
knowing that we should do something or that a specific action would be
in our best interest but we do something different insteadâ€¦

The idea of /Monoidealism/ reminds me of the book [[#][*Deep Work* by Cal Newport]].

* Working With Others
* Understanding Systems
* Analyzing Systems
