  <p>
    Most of my project can be found
    on <a href="https://github.com/leoc">github</a>. This is a smaller
    list with some additional documentation that I would like to use
    as a help to keep focus.

	<p>
	  I am an avid Emacs user. Over the years I found org-mode, magit
	  and many more emacs extensions to be indispensible for my
	  workflow. This page is a tangled version of my emacs.d org-mode
	  file.
