First I called it LedgeIt. Then I thought ledge isn't
even a real english verb, so why not make it some more
artsy-fartsy. Call it ledgit, seems legit to me.
And now I found out, that this term is in the urban dictionary. I
think it's the right name for that script.

A friend of mine introduced me to the magnificent commandline
accounting tool [[https://github.com/jwiegley/ledger][ledger]].
I like the idea a lot, but I miss the comfort of having all banking
account transactions synchronized automatically. So I wrote [[https://github.com/leoc/ledgit][ledgit]].

Ledgit provides a simple procedure. First it reads your ledger files
and creates an index, so it can later on approximate the right ledger
accounts and transaction names for the synchronized entries. Then it
invokes the account handlers, which logs into the online banking
website, downloads the last transactions as CSV and parses the data
into a hash structure, that the generic ledgit method may use to
update your ledger files.

I would love to see some people writing handlers for
different online banking websites. It's basically surfing the website
via the ~mechanize~ gem.

To get a clue of the API that handler class
has to implement, have a look at
[[https://github.com/leoc/ledgit/blob/master/lib/handler/dkb.rb][leoc/ledgit/lib/handler/dkb.rb]].
