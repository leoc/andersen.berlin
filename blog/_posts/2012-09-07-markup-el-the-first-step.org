I had some time yesterday and decided to port the
[[https://github.com/arielnetworks/cl-markup][cl-markup]] package to emacs lisp.

What I came up with I called `markup.el`.

You can check out the [[https://github.com/leoc/markup.el][code on GitHub]].
Now you can easily generate HTML or XML from emacs lisp.

The easiest thing you can do is generate simple tags.

#+begin_src elisp
(markup (:p "This is a simple example")) ;; => "<p>This is a simple example</p>"
#+end_src

But you can easily create a full html5 document aswell:

#+begin_src elisp
(markup-html5
  (:div :style "border: 1px solid #000"
     "Some content of the div!"))
;; => "<!DOCTYPE html><html><div style=\"border: 1px solid #000\">Some content of the div!</div></html>"
#+end_src

You can even mix in some other expressions or variables:

#+begin_src elisp
(let ((maximum 5))
  (markup-html5
   (:body
    (:ul
     (loop for x from 1 to maximum
           collect
           (markup (:li  x " / " maximum)))))))
;; => "<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><ul><li>1 / 5</li><li>2 / 5</li><li>3 / 5</li><li>4 / 5</li><li>5 / 5</li></ul></body></html>"
#+end_src

This is my first step towards an emacs lisp static website generator.
The next step will be to extract the meta information from org files
and integrate their content into layouts that have been described in
markup.el compatible files.
