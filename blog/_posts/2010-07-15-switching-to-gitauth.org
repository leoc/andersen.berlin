After some struggling with Gitosis I decided to go with GitAuth to
administrate my private git repositories. Not only it is superior
because it is written in Ruby. No, it provides a simple commandline
interface to handle all the users, groups, repositories and
permissions. I also appreciate the data stored in yml files for easy
access from whatever software you may write in the future.

It was written by Brown Beagle Software. There is an easy guide at
[[http://github.com/brownbeagle/gitauth][GitHub]].

I went the `git clone` way and had the setup running in five minutes.
Since I use Debian with Ruby Enterprise Edition I had to fix some
issues that occured to me when ever I tried to access the created
repositories. I don't know whether it works for your out of the box or
not.
