Last year I began developing a simple gem for managing the Kindles
collection data. Somehow I lost track of it over the past months.
As I got some new eBooks for my Kindle I reminded myself of that small
project and made it usable again.

Check it out its [[http://leoc.github.com/rindle][Github Page]].

Here is a basic example:

#+begin_src ruby
require 'rindle'

Rindle.load '/path/to/kindle/mount/'

# Then just access collections and documents via their object representation
coll = Rindle::Collection.find_by_name 'my collection'
doc = Rindle::Document.find_by_name 'A book.pdf'
coll.add doc
coll.rename! 'a collection'

Rindle.save!
#+end_src
