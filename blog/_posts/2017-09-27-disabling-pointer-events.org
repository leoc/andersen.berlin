I just found out that you can make a page element "unclickable".
Meaning that any click on this element will be registered by the
element below this respective element.

This is especially useful if you want to put an overlay on top of
something (absolutely positioned) and want to be the underlying layer
to be clickable.

#+BEGIN_SRC css
.unclickable {
  pointer-events: none;
}
#+END_SRC
