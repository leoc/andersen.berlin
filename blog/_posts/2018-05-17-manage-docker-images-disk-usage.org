A while ago I was finding that ~ncdu /~ shows that docker is using a lot
of disk space. I showed how to remove volumes in [[https://www.andersen.berlin/blog/2017/07/17/manage-docker-volume-disk-size/][Manage Docker Volume
Disk Size]]. But volumes are not the only thing that can claim disk
space.

A usual suspect are images that are not used anymore. You can get a
list of images that are not tagged anymore via:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker images -q --filter "dangling=true"
#+END_SRC

To delete them all, hit:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker rmi $(docker images -q --filter "dangling=true")
#+END_SRC
