For the next project at work I have to interface Microsoft SqlServer
2008 from my rails applications. The setup is quite simple. First we
need unixODBC. Normally Mac OS X ships with iODBC, but since I use
linux servers, I wanted to use the layer that's going to be used on my
production systems aswell.

Lets start!

#+begin_src sh
brew install unixodbc
#+end_src

Next, we need FreeTDS, which is a free implementation of the Tabular
Data Stream protocol.

#+begin_src sh
brew edit freetds
#+end_src

Add ~--with-unixodbc=/usr/local~ to the ~./configure~ line. Then:

#+begin_src sh
brew install freetds
#+end_src

Then I created ~~/.freetds.conf~ and added:

#+begin_src conf
[development_db]
host = <Database IP>
port = 1433
tds version = 8.0
client charset = UTF-8
#+end_src

Edited ~/usr/local/etc/odbcinst.ini~ and added:

#+begin_src conf
[FreeTDS]
Description = TD Driver (MSSQL)
Driver = /usr/local/lib/libtdsodbc.so
Setup = /usr/local/lib/libtdsodbc.so
FileUsage = 1
#+end_src

And ~~/.odbc.ini~

#+begin_src conf
[development_db]
Driver= /usr/local/lib/libtdsodbc.so
Servername=development_db
Server=<Database IP>
Port=1433
Database=<database>
TDS_Version=8.0
#+end_src

To use the odbc connection, I just needed to install two ruby gems.
Just add the following to your ~Gemfile~.

#+begin_src ruby
gem "activerecord-sqlserver-adapter"
gem "ruby-odbc"
#+end_src

I ran ~bundle install~ and configured my ~config/database.yml~

#+begin_src yaml
adapter: sqlserver
mode: odbc
username: <login>
password: <password>
database: <database>
dsn:  development_db
#+end_src
