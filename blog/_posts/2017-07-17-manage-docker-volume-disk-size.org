Today I was confused about the missing disk space on my development
machine. I ran ~ncdu /~ only to find out that a lot of the disk is
used by docker volumes.

So I began investigating which volumes are actually taking this much
space:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker system df -v
#+END_SRC

Which showed a lot of local volumes that were taking a lot of GB.
These were the result of containers which mounted volumes to the wrong
endpoint within the container, so that the volumes grew heavily.

I deleted the largest container first (40 GB):

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker volume rm <VOLUME_NAME>
#+END_SRC

But then decided to find dangling volumes:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker volume ls -q -f dangling=true
#+END_SRC

These can be easily removed via:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker volume rm `docker volume ls -q -f dangling=true`
#+END_SRC

This should be executed from time to time, to remove volumes which
surreptitiously took a lot of your disk space.
