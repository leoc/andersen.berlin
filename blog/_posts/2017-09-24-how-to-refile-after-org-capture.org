I am using org-protocol and capture things from within my browser and
from my window manager (awesomewm). Some templates are generic ~TODO~
headings and need to be refiled to the correct location.

This simple script refiles certain templates (e.g. "a" and "c") when
finalizing the capturing process.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun leoc/refile-maybe ()
    (let ((key (org-capture-get :key)))
      (when (member key '("a" "c"))
	(org-refile))))

  (add-hook 'org-capture-before-finalize-hook 'leoc/refile-maybe)
#+END_SRC
