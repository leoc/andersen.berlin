Alright. There I am. Another cool guy with a blog powered by Jekyll.

Now I just need some content. A typical problem.

Anyway. The setup is fairly simple. I am using two directories for the
blog.

One ~/srv/blog/source~, in which I export the current repository data.
One ~/srv/blog/public~, where Jekyll puts the generated page files.

Then I just had to install the following script as ~post-update~ hook
for my blog repository which executes this rule on every push.

#+begin_src sh
#!/bin/sh
rm -rf /srv/blog/source/*
git --bare --git-dir=/home/git/repositories/blog.git archive master | tar xC /srv/blog/source
jekyll /srv/blog/source /srv/blog/public
#+end_src

Do not forget to make the hook executable:

#+begin_src sh
$ chown +x /home/git/repositories/blog.git/hooks/post-update
#+end_src

Afterwards I configured my web server to serve my files from ~/srv/blog/public~

Now with every push to my blogs repository it will automatically get deployed.
What a wonderful world.
