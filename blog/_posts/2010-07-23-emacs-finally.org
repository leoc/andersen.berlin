title: Emacs ... Finally?
layout: post

Over the past few years I have been changing my development
environments regularly. I began using a simple editor like nano or the
windows editor (shame on me, but it's the only good software you get
with windows)

Lately I have settled down using TextMate on the Mac for all of my
ruby development.
It's a fairly neat editor but I'm running linux on my workstation so I
always have to run against my habits when changing the environments.
That's kind of annoying.

A friend suggested emacs and what I can tell for now is that it's a
pretty neat thing!
