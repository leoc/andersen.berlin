I just published my first ruby gem. It's called ~EM::SystemCommand~
and serves as an abstration to popen3 calls. You can easily execute
system commands and handle the data that's been written to their
~stdout~ or ~stderr~.

Check it out its [[http://leoc.github.com/em-systemcommand][Github Page]].

Here is a basic example:

#+begin_src ruby
EM.run do
  ps = EM::SystemCommand.new 'my_command' do |on|
    on.success do |ps|
      puts 'Success!'
    end

    on.failure do |ps|
      puts 'Failure!'
    end

    on.stdout.line do |line|
      puts "Line received: #{line}"
    end
  end

  ps.stdin << "some data"
end
#+end_src
