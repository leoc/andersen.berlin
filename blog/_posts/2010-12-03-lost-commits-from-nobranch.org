title: Git - Lost Commits From No Branch

I did a mistake when working on submodule clone instead of a manual
cloned repository.

That means as I checked out the master branch, my commits from the
previous 'no-branch' state where reverted. To save them just do it
like that:

#+begin_src sh
cd cloned-repo
git reflog
git checkout master
git cherry-pick sha_of_the_missing_commit
#+end_src

Note to myself: Always check out the master branch before modifying
submodule clones.
