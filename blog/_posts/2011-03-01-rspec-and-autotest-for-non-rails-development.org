I recently started a little new project. But since I were very spoiled
by all the glitter of rails development, I struggled some time setting
up rspec and autotest for my new project.
And ... Mea Culpa! It really is that simple.

Simply create a ~spec/spec_helper.rb~ file, to require rspec and the
libs that you want to test. Maybe it's gonna be a gem, so you have to
adjust the load path.

#+begin_src ruby
$LOAD_PATH.unshift(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'lib'))
$LOAD_PATH.unshift(File.dirname(__FILE__))

require 'rubygems'
require 'rspec'

require 'my_lib'

Rspec.configure do |config|
  # give me something to do!
end
#+end_src

And configure autotest to discover RSpec2 in ~autotest/discover.rb~

#+begin_src ruby
Autotest.add_discovery { "rspec2" }
#+end_src

That's it. Just run ~autotest~ in the root of you project.

I added some more like rspec parameters in ~.rspec~ and the
~autotest/fs-event~ inside of the ~.autotest~ file.
