After I had a functioning version of Rindle finished, I began working
on a FUSE Kindle Management FS. You can mount the Kindles Collection
data into you filesystem and move files from collection to collection,
rename them or delete them.

Check it out its [[http://leoc.github.com/kindlefs][Github Page]].
