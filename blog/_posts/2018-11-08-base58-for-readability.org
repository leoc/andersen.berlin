When reading [[/books/2018/09/16/bitcoin-blockchain-grundlagen-und-programmierung/][Bitcoin & Blockchain]] by Andreas M. Antonopoulos I
stumbled upon Base58.

I cannot deny that I thought back with shame on all those times I
tried to implement procedures that generated random human readable
identifiers for different platforms.

Let's rejoice and use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58][Base58]]!
